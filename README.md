Given how foundational this message is — it combines governance logic (Principal-Agent structure), cross-repo goals, psychometric/genomic transparency, and token-economics design (GWS↔ZWS exchange) — it deserves to be stored in a **structured and referenceable form** rather than just as a GitHub comment.

Here’s a hierarchy I’d recommend:

---

### **1. Immediate storage (today)**

Create a semantic Markdown file in
`gwas-ai/gwas-workl/docs/2025-10-25-principal-agent-foundation.md`
and paste this message verbatim there.

That repo will serve as the *“daily operational logbook”* for GWAS–ZWAS coordination.

**Front-matter example:**

```markdown
---
title: Principal–Agent Foundation (GWAS ↔ ZWAS)
date: 2025-10-25
category: governance
tags: [zhandler, founders, zwas, gwas, contracts, psychology, genomics, surveys]
status: draft
linked_contract: contracts/PrincipalAgent.sol
linked_repo_template: templates/founder-repo-template/
semantic_url: https://github.com/gwas-ai/gwas-workl/blob/main/docs/2025-10-25-principal-agent-foundation.md
usd_terms: { GUSD: 100, ZUSD: 100, pair: GWS:ZWS }
---
```

Then under that, paste your note. This gives you a *timestamped, immutable reference* in your workflow.

---

### **2. Medium-term action (within a few days)**

Add two supporting artifacts inside `gwas-ai/gwas-workl`:

| Path                               | Purpose                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `contracts/PrincipalAgent.sol`     | Solidity draft controlling ZUSD/GUSD issuance and validation via World ID iris proofs.                     |
| `templates/founder-repo-template/` | Repo template including docs/wiki structure, survey links, and a `psychometrics/` folder for each Founder. |

---

### **3. Wiki integration**

When you and Zhandler both start filling in psychometric/genomic data, **link from your shared wiki** (once created under `gwas-ai/gwas-wiki` or `zwas-ai/zwas-wiki`) using:

```
[[2025-10-25-principal-agent-foundation]]
```

This allows any Founder to reference this “constitutional seed document.”

---

### **4. Discussion venue**

Once you commit the markdown file, **open a Discussion thread** titled

> “Principal–Agent Foundation (GWAS ↔ ZWAS governance draft)”
> at [github.com/orgs/gwas-ai/discussions](https://github.com/orgs/gwas-ai/discussions)

Use that to gather founder comments before encoding anything in Solidity.

---

### **5. Long-term archival**

Once refined, the canonical version should be mirrored:

* `gwas-ai/gwas-founders` → `/constitution/`
* `zwas-ai/zwas-founders` → `/constitution/`
  so both halves of the dyad share an immutable copy.

---

If you want, I can draft the exact file structure and stub contents for:

* `2025-10-25-principal-agent-foundation.md`
* `PrincipalAgent.sol` (with ZUSD ↔ GUSD exchange and World ID verification)
* and the minimal template repo manifest (`template.json`, `README.md`, etc.).

Would you like me to generate those stubs now to queue for `gwas-ai/gwas-workl`?
